Huismus (House Sparrow)
The Huismus (House Sparrow) prefers to live in close proximity to humans, typically nesting in or on buildings. Their food often comes from humans, either intentionally or unintentionally, and includes seeds, grains, insects, flower buds, bread, berries, peanuts, and fat balls. During the breeding season, their diet mainly consists of insects. To support the House Sparrow, it is important to ensure that there is sufficient cover near the nesting box, with greenery that is at least 3 to 4 meters high, as well as accessible food, sand, water, and potential sleeping places within 50 to 100 meters. House Sparrows are not particularly fond of areas with many tall trees. They prefer to nest in colonies, so it is recommended to place at least two nest boxes together, although more is better. The nest entrance should be oriented towards the north, east, or northeast. Nest boxes should be installed at a height of 3 to 10 meters and at least 50 centimetres apart from each other. Another option is to modify the roof space by adjusting the bird-proofing materials under roof tiles, allowing the first two battens to serve as a breeding site. This should be implemented over a minimum of 5 meters of the roof. The gap between the roof structure and the roof tiles must be at least 7.5 centimetres, making it suitable for accessible nest sites.

Gierzwaluw (Swift)
The Gierzwaluw (Swift) is a migratory bird that stays in the Netherlands from April to August and spends the rest of the year in warmer climates. Most of its life is spent in the air, even sleeping while flying. The only time they settle is during the breeding season, when they nest in building crevices and under roofs. They perceive the built environment as a rock landscape, and the cracks and openings in buildings serve as ideal nesting spots for them.
Swifts are colonial breeders, so it's essential to create a cluster of at least 5 to 20 nesting places per building, preferably integrated into the building structure. These birds prefer to nest at heights of up to 40 meters, often in blind or monotone walls of buildings. It is crucial to maintain a flight path of at least 3 meters in front of and below the nesting spots, free from obstructions such as trees or buildings, as swifts need to drop several meters when taking flight. Although it may take years for a swift to occupy a nesting brick, once one does, others will soon follow, as they are highly loyal to their nesting sites and return for generations. Swifts do not cause nuisance; they use minimal nesting material and do not leave messes on building façades. Additionally, the nesting bricks do not require cleaning. To support their feeding, it is beneficial to provide herb-rich greenery in the project area. However, swifts mainly feed over a large area, catching "aeroplankton" (tiny airborne insects) in flight. Ideally, their nesting sites should be within 500 meters of a water-rich and insect-rich grassland, which provides an optimal food source.

Huiszwaluw (House Martin)
The Huiszwaluw (House Martin) is a bird species that prefers wet environments where mosquitoes, their primary food source, are abundant. These birds typically nest under white overhangs near roof edges, and they can either use artificial nests or build their own using clay and sand. House Martins often prefer to be near water and grassland, which provide them with essential resources for feeding. To support House Martins in urban environments, artificial nests can be installed in clusters of at least five nest bowls per building. These nests should be mounted on external walls under overhangs, at a height of at least 4 meters and up to a maximum of 10 meters. Ideally, the nests should face northeast. House Martins are colonial nesters, so part of the nest bowls should be grouped together, although they can also nest alone. One important aspect of their habitat is the need for a clear flight path of at least 4 meters in front of and below the nest. This ensures that they have the space to take flight without obstruction from buildings or trees. In addition, they need a minimum of 3 meters of open space directly outside their nests, allowing them to drop into flight easily. The preferred locations for nesting are under white overhangs or eaves, typically at the corners or gable ends of buildings. House Martins are also known for their ability to build their own nests using clay and sand, which they attach to building facades. To facilitate this, having a mud pool within 200 meters of the nesting site is important, as it provides the material they need for nest construction.

Merel, roodborst & andere struikbroeders (Blackbird, Robin, and other shrub-nesting birds)
The Merel (Blackbird), Roodborst (Robin), and other shrub-nesting birds have specific habitat requirements. These birds prefer to nest in dense shrubs, hedges, green facades like ivy, or in low trees. To support species like the blackbird and robin, the planting of native, thorny shrubs is recommended. Suitable plants include firethorn, which can be planted against facades or as standalone hedges. Firethorn not only provides edible berries for birds but also offers a safer nesting place due to its thorns. Additionally, firethorn shrubs remain green throughout the year, making them more appealing during winter compared to other deciduous plants like hornbeam.These birds benefit from higher biodiversity through insect-friendly mowing practices, leaving fallen leaves, and using native plant species. Climbing shrubs, such as wisteria, are excellent for placing against a pergola, offering birds a nesting place, shelter from predators, and food in the form of berries, seeds, and insects. In winter, such shrubs also provide an important resting spot. The key to supporting these species lies in creating plant variety, which enhances biodiversity and supports more animal species.

Spreeuw (Starling)
The Spreeuw (Starling) is one of the most common breeding birds in the Netherlands, but its numbers are in decline. Starlings nest in cavities in buildings or older trees with hollows. They are omnivores, but primarily feed on insects and insect larvae found in grassland. Therefore, a combination of nest boxes or older trees with cavities for breeding, along with nearby grassland for foraging, creates a favorable living environment for the Starling. Additionally, berry-bearing shrubs can be planted to provide extra food. When installing nest boxes, it is recommended to place them at a height of 2 to 5 meters and avoid placing them in direct sunlight, as this can make the boxes too hot in the summer. Nest boxes should be placed in a sheltered location, ideally with the entrance facing northeast, as the prevailing winds in the Netherlands come from the southwest. While Starlings are not colony breeders, they do prefer nesting near other members of their species, so it’s beneficial to place multiple boxes in proximity.

Koolmees (Great Tit) and Pimpelmees (Blue Tit)
The Koolmees (Great Tit) and Pimpelmees (Blue Tit) are small birds commonly found in gardens, parks, and wooded areas, as long as there is sufficient nesting opportunity and food available. These birds often nest in tree cavities, sheds, or nest boxes. Their diet consists mainly of caterpillars, small insects, beech nuts, and other seeds. They also greatly benefit from human activity, especially when fat balls and feeders are provided. Both species are territorial, and birds of the same species prefer to nest at least 10 meters apart. For different species, such as the Great Tit and the Blue Tit, nest boxes can be placed around 3 meters apart. The minimum installation height for the boxes is 2 meters. The entrance holes should face north, east, or northeast to avoid exposure to wind and rain. To help support these species, nest boxes should be installed at the recommended height and distance, with greenery around to provide shelter and attract insects. Placing a large tree with dense foliage, like a beech, oak, or hawthorn, will help keep these birds in the garden.

Slechtvalk (Peregrine Falcon)
The Slechtvalk (Peregrine Falcon) is a bird of prey that typically hunts far from its nest, favoring open landscapes rich in birdlife. Outside the breeding season, it mostly hunts in open areas, preying on jackdaws, city pigeons, and black crows, as well as smaller bird species. Peregrine falcons are mostly found in highly urbanized areas and are generally not seen in villages. An overpopulation of peregrine falcons in one area can lead to a decline in smaller bird species, which is often undesirable. For nesting, peregrine falcons use ledges, niches, nest boxes, or old crow nests in cities, and in open farmland, they may nest in high-voltage pylons. Before creating nest sites for peregrine falcons, it is crucial to determine whether an existing nest box or other breeding site is nearby. If there are too many nest boxes, placing a new one loses its value for peregrine falcons and can lead to an overpopulation of these birds, which negatively affects other species. It is recommended to place a maximum of one nest box per neighborhood, on buildings with a minimum height of 25 meters, but preferably at a height of 80-120 meters.

Zwarte Roodstaart (Black Redstart)
The Zwarte Roodstaart (Black Redstart) is a bird species that prefers open, sunny, dry, and undeveloped areas near their nesting sites. This bird typically lives either alone or in pairs for most of the year and sings from a high perch of at least 20 meters. It's essential for the black redstart that the surrounding area of the nest includes open terrain with little vegetation. The black redstart is drawn to large-scale new constructions and tends to avoid highly vegetated areas. To support this species, small patches of fallow land with short vegetation should be preserved. One of the ideal habitats for black redstarts is "brown roofs." These roofs consist of a substrate made from crushed stone, ranging from 25 mm gravel to finer materials, laid at a depth of 5 to 15 cm. Some larger stones and pieces of wood can be placed on the roof, allowing plants to grow naturally over time. Brown roofs offer a suitable nesting environment for black redstarts, especially in sunny, dry conditions. The species tends to avoid wet environments and areas with dense, tall crops, as they are insectivores that require open areas for foraging. When it comes to nest sites, the nest box should be placed in buildings on a sheltered spot facing north or east. These can be installed on residential buildings, high industrial structures, or farm barns. A maximum of two nest boxes should be installed per project, and they should be positioned at least 2 meters above the ground, though higher is preferred, particularly near brown roofs. The same nest boxes for black redstarts can also be used by the white wagtail.

Gewone Dwergvleermuis (Common Pipistrelle Bat)
The Gewone Dwergvleermuis (Common Pipistrelle Bat) is a species that typically uses different kinds of shelters for roosting and foraging, staying relatively close to their roosting sites. They hunt within a radius of 2-5 kilometers from their roosting place. Their diet consists mostly of insects such as midges, caddisflies, mayflies, lacewings, moths, and occasionally beetles. For navigation, they rely on tree lines and water bodies in the landscape. They forage in sheltered areas such as gardens, parks with ponds, along tree canopies, over clearings in the forest, and along woodland edges, favoring rich, old deciduous forests. They also hunt around streetlamps and along avenues, tree rows, hedgerows, and grassy fields. Water bodies and sheltered shores are favorite hunting grounds. The ideal environment for the Common Pipistrelle should have a sheltered, insect-rich habitat near the roosting site. It is recommended to plant native trees, shrubs, and flowers within the project area to attract insects. It is important that roosting locations are well connected to the broader landscape through tree and water corridors. The roosting sites should also be located in non-illuminated areas, as bats avoid well-lit areas for safety. For the roosting places, a variety of types can be used, such as cavities within building walls, built-in bat boxes, or behind façade cladding. Roosts should be placed at a height of 4 to 50 meters and should not be located within 1 meter of windows. Additionally, different roosting sites with various microclimates should be provided by incorporating multiple layers and orientations. This approach ensures that the Common Pipistrelle Bat has a suitable habitat for both roosting and foraging, allowing the species to thrive in urban or semi-urban environments.

Gerelateerde soorten vleermuizen (Related Bat Species)
The Gerelateerde soorten vleermuizen (Related Bat Species) include various types of bats that share similar habitat requirements to the Common Pipistrelle. These species include the Laatvlieger (Noctule), Tweekleurige Vleermuis (Parti-Coloured Bat), and the Kleine Dwergvleermuis (Soprano Pipistrelle). For Laatvlieger (Noctule): This bat species hunts in open to semi-open landscapes, often near forest edges, hedgerows, and avenues. They can hunt up to 15 kilometers away from their roosting sites, feeding mainly on larger insects like moths and beetles. They mostly roost in buildings, particularly in wall cavities, behind cladding, under eaves, or in attic spaces. Though no proven bat boxes are effective for them yet, they tend to use a network of buildings within a few hundred meters of each other. For Tweekleurige Vleermuis (Parti-Coloured Bat): This species primarily hunts in open spaces, diving for insects in urban environments, particularly above water. During summer, the Parti-Coloured Bat roosts in crevices and cracks in rocks or buildings. In the Netherlands, they are known to use wall cavities and spaces under roof tiles. For Kleine Dwergvleermuis (Soprano Pipistrelle): Similar to the Common Pipistrelle, the Soprano Pipistrelle prefers water-rich areas like river valleys combined with wooded environments. Their behavior and diet closely resemble that of the Common Pipistrelle, though not much is known about their specific behavior in the Netherlands. Buildings, roof layers, and spaces behind façade cladding are likely roosting spots. For Gewone Grootoorvleermuis (Brown Long-Eared Bat): This species hunts in sheltered areas in forested landscapes or small-scale park-like environments. They roost in various places, including attics, behind cladding, under roof tiles, and in tree hollows. In winter, they seek underground spaces to hibernate. By incorporating suitable roosting locations and ensuring that areas are connected with water lines and tree rows, these bat species can thrive in both urban and semi-urban settings.

Egel (Hedgehog)
The Egel (Hedgehog) is a species that thrives in gardens, woodland edges, thickets, and deciduous forests, particularly where there is undergrowth. These areas provide ideal living habitats for hedgehogs. They can also be found in urban areas, as long as there are continuous green zones, gardens, and shelters available. Hedgehogs primarily feed on small ground insects and other invertebrates, such as earthworms and slugs. Their diet can also include small amphibians, young mammals, eggs, carrion, and plant material. In summer, hedgehogs often sleep on bare ground under dense bushes, in hollows beneath tree roots, in compost heaps, or rabbit burrows. Sometimes, they build sleeping nests out of loose leaves. The nest for their young is usually well-hidden, such as in a compost pile, heap of branches, or debris. For winter, hedgehogs typically build their hibernation nests in the ground, against a fence, in a shed or outbuilding, or within a pile of branches or compost. The size of these winter nests can vary greatly, sometimes reaching up to half a meter in diameter. To ensure a suitable habitat, it is important to create openings in fences and hedges throughout the area, allowing hedgehogs access to a large enough living space. For males, this can range between 20-40 hectares, while for females, it is between 10-20 hectares.

Eekhoorn (Squirrel)
The Eekhoorn (Squirrel) is commonly found in deciduous, coniferous, or mixed forests, but also in gardens, parks, and wooded banks near forests. If there is enough food available, squirrels will even be found in urban areas. Their preferred habitat is older forests (coniferous trees older than 20 years and deciduous trees older than 40 years), as these provide more food and nesting opportunities. Squirrels avoid sunny spots, favoring shaded areas instead. Their natural predators include foxes, birds of prey, and pine martens. Squirrels primarily feed on tree seeds, such as acorns, nuts, pinecones, and conifer cones. Their diet varies with the seasons and may include buds, leaves, berries, bark, fungi, caterpillars, bird eggs, and even young birds. They build nests in trees, especially in winter when their nests are easily visible due to the lack of leaves. Sometimes, they also use tree cavities, old crow or magpie nests, or large nest boxes. If there is enough old forest available, nest boxes are not required. However, traffic arteries and busy roads pose challenges to squirrels in certain areas. In such cases, "squirrel bridges" can be installed between trees over impassable areas to provide safe passage. If a squirrel nest box is used, it should be placed in a tree at a minimum height of 3 meters, with the entrance not facing the southwest to avoid rain.

Bijen (Bees) and Vlinders (Butterflies)
For both Bijen (Bees) and Vlinders (Butterflies), the primary focus is on creating an environment rich in flowers and herbs, which serve as an essential food source. These insects depend on the nectar and pollen of flowers for their survival. To ensure their well-being, it is crucial to provide a diverse range of native plants that bloom from early spring to late autumn. Many insects have specific preferences for plants they use both for food and for reproduction. For example, certain plants are used to lay eggs or for metamorphosis. In addition to a varied vegetation structure with different levels and relief, the landscape should offer necessary shelter for these insects. Natural habitats for these species include crevices in stone walls, dead wood, bark, and even in the soil. Many insects find suitable living conditions in these kinds of environments. By maintaining wild, natural areas, such as sand or stone piles, and avoiding too much human interference, the bees and butterflies can thrive. Adding insect hotels and built-in stones in walls or buildings also supports healthy populations of wild bees and butterflies, which are vital to pollination processes, including those that humans rely on for crops. Such hotels and stones should be placed in sheltered locations, protected from wind and rain, near native nectar- and pollen-rich flowers, plants, or shrubs. Butterfly boxes can be integrated into both sun-exposed and shaded walls. Shaded boxes serve as overwintering spots for species like the peacock butterfly and the small tortoiseshell. Bee boxes should be hung in sunny spots, as more hours of sunlight improve their performance. Bee hotels can also be placed on rooftops, and nesting stones for wild bees can be built into the masonry of new buildings. These should be positioned on the sun-facing side of buildings and placed at heights between 50 centimeters and 2 meters.

Amfibieën (Amphibians)
The Amfibieën (Amphibians) include species such as frogs, toads, and newts, which require both water and moist land environments to thrive. Amphibians, like the green and brown frogs, the common newt, and the common toad, benefit from natural ponds that feature a combination of water and greenery, allowing them to reproduce in the water. These species need a habitat where there is a strip of shoreline vegetation, as they often lay their eggs on or near such plants. Without these plants, many amphibians will not lay eggs.
The ponds should have areas deep enough to prevent them from drying out in the spring and summer. Usually, a depth of around 1.5 meters is sufficient. Additionally, the north side of the pond should have a gently sloping bank to allow the water to warm up quickly in the sun, which is beneficial for the development of larvae. The water should be clean and either still or slow-flowing, particularly for species like the newt.
On land, the surrounding environment is equally important. Woodland and tall herbaceous vegetation provide shelter and overwintering opportunities for many amphibians, but care must be taken to ensure that the pond is not overly shaded, as too much shade can hinder the development of amphibian larvae. It is also beneficial to create a network of wetland areas, connecting different ponds or linking them to a ditch system to allow the animals to move between habitats.
These natural water features not only provide amphibians with a place to live and reproduce but also offer drinking water for birds and serve as habitats for insects, contributing to the broader ecosystem.
