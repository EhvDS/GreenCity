Welcome to the **Nature-Inclusive Interventions Gallery** â€“ an interactive tool designed to inspire and guide eco-friendly urban planning. This gallery brings together various nature-based solutions that foster biodiversity, manage water resources effectively, and create healthier, greener cityscapes.

Through this gallery, users can explore a curated selection of interventions, each detailed with its benefits, spatial requirements, and potential environmental impact. The goal is to offer an accessible resource that supports informed decision-making for urban planners, environmental advocates, and engaged citizens alike.

**Dive into the project [here](https://intervention-gallery-poc.vercel.app/)** to explore how sustainable choices can transform our urban environments.
